            "I am an architect graduated in 2016 from the --Polytechnic University of Valencia--, based in Berlin and in mid-2019 I discovered and took my first steps in the field of web development and software engineering.",
            "Passionate about detail, as a --front-end developer-- I enjoy writing well-written and efficient code that translates into attractive and functional interfaces with modern frameworks. My 5-year experience as an architect has taught me not only the basics of design, the good development of projects but also has taught me to work as a team, the collective ownership of projects and empathy to share my experience and knowledge with my team.",
            "I enjoy reading, especially the fantasy genre, so --when I am not in front of the computer--, I am probably enjoying a good book, learning new things or going for a run."
